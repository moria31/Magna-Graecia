All credits to DW8030 and their 3rd & 4th Unique Component Mod for the Acropolis image.
Acropolis and Hoplite are placeholders, at least in their current form.

Planned: Macedonian Peltast DONE! > Sparta DONE! > Thebes > Hoplite replacement > Corinth (Probably) > Argos (Maybe?) > Minoans/Pergamon/Syracuse/etc (Maybe?)
